# CosmosExplorerBot
An explorer for humans.ai (or any Cosmos-based network, for that matter!) that works in Telegram.

Using Python and an API server, the bot gets all the info needed about **chain ID**, current **block height**, and an **active set** of validators.
If you want to see the details of a specific validators, **valoper address**, **commission rates**, **descriptions** & **websites** are all displayed.

While interacting with bot's menu, all the info is updated in **real time**.
